## Overview of the Project
#### Two simple analysis were conducted to interpret the dataset. the first one was focused on finding on a conclusion for Outcomes based on goals. The summary of this outcome is stated below. The second analysis was to arrive at conclusion for Kickstarters that fall within the 'Theater' category versus their launch date based on certain outcomes.

#### This project allows a student to use a predefined set of data, dissect it to get even more specific data, and be able to interpret using basic _Excel_ functions. A good example for that could be the unix epoch data that was converted to extract a human readable version of the year for more analysis.
#### Although it was a bit challenging, the project allowed me to use my newly learned skills and apply them to arrive at a conclusion.

## Analysis and Challenges
#### the biggest challenge i encountered during the project was adding more criteria in 'COUNTIFS' function. I messed it up multiple times before I got a hold of it. Once that was done, the rest of the project was a breeze. I like how to embed a picture in a .md file. Outcomes vs Goals delivery shows us that as the goal of each Kickstarter increases, the success rate tend to be lower, and the chance of failure increases proportionally to one another.

## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
#### The theater outcome by launched date shows that more successful Theater projects are launched around the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the year.The overall project launched for that category decreases as their launch date moves toward the end of the year. Lastly, the quantity of successful Theater related projects appears to be about two times the total failed projects for that same category.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
#### Outcomes vs Goals delivery shows us that as the goal of each Kickstarter increases, the success rate tend to be lower, and the chance of failure increases proportionally to one another.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
#### The dataset isn't as granular as one would expect. A data analyst would have to interpret the data and separate some pieces from another to make it more manageable. On a financial aspect, not all projects were funded using the dollar currency. the data provides it in USD but it doesn't tell a reader what exchange rate was used for the conversion, if one was done. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
#### A huge number of tables and graphs could be created using this dataset. We should be able to determine if launched Kickstarter projects tend to be more successful based on a specific location. Hopefully, the meaning of each country abbreviation would be provided. This would remove some of the guessed work to interpret the country data in column G.
